## LPN9
The year is 3812.
You were built with one purpose, to find and rescue Ada.
Why a robot, because she is in Hades, and no one has ever returned.
But maybe this little robot can.

You are making your way through the Underworld.
You will encounter dangerous DragZards and Fire.
You will have to traverse the many layers as you travle down.

Down, down, down until finding an exit for each maze.
An exit that leads to another maze.

## LPN9 : Controls
* A - Jump (keyboard space or c)
* B - Electric Jolt (keyboard z)
* Y - Hang on a wall (keyboard x)

## LPN9 : Game Elements
* Your batteries are your life, without them you won't make it
* Batteries Drain over Time, but are refilled upon being transported to a new level
* Getting hit by a DragZard takes about a full battery of energy

## LPN9 : Hints
* You are not the first, those who came before left a breadcrumb through the exits
* There could be places to charge up, they may not be on the path, but they may help
* You are going down into Underworld, so each level you start at the top, and need to find a safe way down.
